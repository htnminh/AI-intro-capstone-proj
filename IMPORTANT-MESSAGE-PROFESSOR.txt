IMPORTANT-MESSAGE-PROFESSOR.txt

--------------------------------------------------

Dear Professor Muriel Visani,

I'm the group leader, and this is a VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE that might prevent you
from getting lost in the directory of our project.

It won't take more than a few minutes, so please read it carefully.

1. You asked for Python files only. Unfortunately, our project is too complicated
to work only with them. WITHOUT the OTHER TYPES of files, the Python files WILL
NOT WORK PROPERLY. Thank you for your understanding.

2. This is an exhaustive list of VERY IMPORTANT PYTHON FILES. Please don't try to
run any of them before reading all this instruction.

- `AI_intro_project\Coordinate_and_Move.py` and `AI_intro_project\State.py`:
    The core game.

- `AI_intro_project\play.py`:
    The UI of the game.

- `AI_intro_project\StateRandomizer.py`:
    The file to randomly generate and save initial states.
    
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\astar_Sfirst.py`:
    The implementation of A*.

- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\dfs.py`:
    The implementation of DFS.

- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\recursive_BFS.py`:
    The implementation of RBFS.

3. If you want to RUN THE CODE, FOLLOW this section carefully, otherwise, feel
free to skip it.

- Make sure that Python (3.9.9) and pip (21.x) are installed on your local machine

- Unzip the zip file (it's safe to use the option `Extract here`)

- Open cmd (yours is terminal), navigate (using `cd`) to that folder
    (`AI-intro-project-main` by default)

- Run
    `pip install .`

- Run this line to open the UI of the game
    `python AI_intro_project\play.py`

If you want to completely remove the game, just delete the zip file and the folder
specified above.

WARNING: Running algorithms or analytical files might cause your computer to get a
bit slow and laggy. Use at your own risk.

Sincerely,
    Hoang Tran Nhat Minh
