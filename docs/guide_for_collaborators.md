# Guide for Collaborators: A guide for everything

## End-to-end rules to work in this project
[Rules](docs/rules.md).

## Guide to GitHub
[Guide to GitHub](docs/guide_to_GitHub.md). If you are new to GitHub or Git, please, read it, practice on GitHub.

> I will not accept non-git-like-operations on the repo, e.g. make changes and reupload a whole directory, since I do not know what did you do.
Moreover, I have no time to read your commits and revert them if you make a mistake.

Practice working on GitHub until you feel confident, and you will be fine.

## Guide to start coding
You have 5 simple things to do:
1. Read the rules, please. I have no time to fix your code.
2. CLONE the repository, NOT DOWNLOAD it.
3. Play the game there.
4. Create a directory named after your algorithm's name in `AI_intro_project`.
5. Start coding there.

## Guide to publication
We should use Notion page for now, because it is easy to use.

> Update: We have a report left, it is long, but a Notion page will work quite well.
