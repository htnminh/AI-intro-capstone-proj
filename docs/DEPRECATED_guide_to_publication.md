3. Insert a picture by using a raw github content link, claim it by opening the picture in a new tab. The link will looks like this <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/c1b88055c082e37e3235a257c6762ef461b0b3dc/publication/Convert%20to%20TeX.PNG>.
4. Upload the TeX file to <https://www.overleaf.com/project>, compile it, then download the compiled PDF file. Remember to choose XeLaTeX as a compiler if the document has Vietnamese characters.
