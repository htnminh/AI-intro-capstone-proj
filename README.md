# The Penniless Pilgrim Riddle: Introduction
The website of the project: <https://htnminh.github.io/AI-intro-project/>

The demo video of the game: <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1umrgx2-0w48aSoWVvgOEyPI1revnNV8j?usp=sharing>

A capstone project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. <br>
A quick introduction of the problem: [Can you solve the penniless pilgrim riddle? - Daniel Finkel](https://youtu.be/6sBB-gRhfjE).

In short, we will keep the original rules of the game, but randomize the board size and the "forced moves" (aka. the initial state).

# Files and Directories in the source code

All of the important files are in the directory `AI_intro_project`
- `AI_intro_project\_initial_states_images`: The images of the randomized initial states.
- `AI_intro_project\_RBFS_solved_state_images`: The images of the solution generated by RBFS algorithm.
- `AI_intro_project\_s_astar-Sf_solved_state_images`: The images of the solution generated by A* algorithm.
- `AI_intro_project\_s_DFS_solved_state_images`: The images of the solution generated by DFS algorithm.
- `AI_intro_project\randomized_states`: The pickle files (default `.pkl` but we use `.state` to distinguish) of the randomized initial states.
- `AI_intro_project\Coordinate_and_Move.py`, `AI_intro_project\State.py`: The Python files for the game.
- `AI_intro_project\play.py`: The Python file for the UI of the game.
- `AI_intro_project\StateRandomizer.py`: Randomly generate and save initial states using a fixed seed.
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\astar_Sfirst.py`: The implementation of A*.
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\dfs.py`: The implementation of DFS.
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\recursive_BFS.py`: The implementation of RBFS.

# Play the game!
Five easy steps to play the game:
1. Make sure that Python and pip are installed on your local machine
2. Download this repository, unzip it
3. Open cmd, change the directory to the folder above (`AI-intro-project-main` by default)
4. Run <br>`pip install .`
5. Run <br>`python AI_intro_project\play.py`<br> to open the UI above

If you want to completely remove the game, just delete the zip file and the directory specified above.

# Collaborators
We are K65 of Hanoi University of Science and Technology, major in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Under the guidance of our lecturer, Professor Muriel Visani, we will together solve this riddle.
