# The Penniless Pilgrim Riddle
## Introduction
A capstone project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. <br>
A quick introduction of the problem: [Can you solve the penniless pilgrim riddle? - Daniel Finkel](https://youtu.be/6sBB-gRhfjE). <br>
In short, we will keep the original rules of the game, but randomize the board size and the "forced moves" (aka. the initial state).

## Collaborators
We are K65 of Hanoi University of Science and Technology, major in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Under the guidance of our lecturer, Professor Muriel Visani, we will together solve this riddle.

## Guide for Collaborators
This is a guide for everything, you MUST read it carefully.

### Guide to publication
We should use Notion page for now, because it is easy to use.

[DEPRECATED guide to publication](docs/DEPRECATED_guide_to_publication.md)


### Guide to GitHub
You should follow the following steps to get yourself familiar with GitHub. Things might get seriously worse if you do something wrong, basically bacause we are coding together. You can see the GitHub's official guide [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) if you cannot do some steps.


- Step 1: I think it will be the best for you to use GitHub Desktop. Download it and do the following jobs.

You MUST understand, and know how to do the following things using GitHub to manage a project, BEFORE doing anything in this repository (feel free to skip this part if you already know how to use GitHub):

- Step 2: Create a repository of your own.
- On that repository...
  - When you start working on the project for the first time:
    - Step 3: `clone`: clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Create, delete, and adjust files (for the first time and later times):
    - Step 4: `fetch` and `pull`: "sync" everything that you and others have done on the repository from cloud to your local machine, you must do this EVERY TIME you start coding.
    - Step 5: Create and write a Python `hello_world.py` file in that directory. I recommend using Visual Studio Code, but you can use any IDE/editor that you are familiar with.
    - Step 6: `commit`: "make a change" to what you have done in the repository, locally. (Each commit could have multiple files change). Please, write a meaningful commit message, in which you shortly describe all what you have done (e.g. create hello_world)
    - Step 7: `push`: "push all changes", i.e. "sync" your recent commit(s) from your local machine to cloud. (Each push could have multiple commits). The best practice is to split your work in an afternoon to multiple tasks, commit each task, and push it right after each commit. (If you cannot push because of files' conflict, do not try to push the conflict up, and let everyone knows about those files right away)
    - Step 8: Take a look at your repository on the web to see your pushed commits. 
  - By now, you have a hands-on experience with basic GitHub, let's practice!
    - Step 9: Repeat from step 4 to step 8, instead in step 5, you can try to create more files, delete some files, adjust some code, and it will work magically the same way you create the `hello_world.py` file.
   

### Introduction to directories in this project
The directory...
- `AI_intro_project`: all the files used to run the project.
- `tests`: scripts used to test Python files in `AI_intro_project`.
- `publication`: all `.ipynb` and `.pdf` files for publication.

### End-to-end rules to work in this project
[Rules](docs/rules.md)

<!--
### Start working
Start working only if you understand and accept to follow the rules above. It will take some time, I know. You will soon feel everything runs smoothly.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your command line, change the directory to the repository location (`AI-intro-project` by default). There are more than two ways of doing this:
  - If you want to use VSCode: open GitHub Desktop, choose Open in Visual Studio Code. In VSCode, create a terminal, and the directory is already there.
  - If you want to use Windows' command line: open it and `cd` there.
3. Run `pip install .`, this will install a package named `AIIntroProject`.
4. Take a look at [`hello_world.py`](https://github.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/blob/main/AI_intro_project/hello_world.py) and [`test_hello_world.py`](https://github.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/blob/main/tests/test_hello_world.py) to understand importation.
5. Start doing your things. Remember to follow the rules, since you are not working alone.
