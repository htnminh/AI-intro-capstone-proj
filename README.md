# The Penniless Pilgrim Riddle
# Introduction
A capstone project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. <br>
A quick introduction of the problem: [Can you solve the penniless pilgrim riddle? - Daniel Finkel](https://youtu.be/6sBB-gRhfjE). <br>
In short, we will keep the original rules of the game, but randomize the board size and the "forced moves" (aka. the initial state).

### Start working
Start working only if you understand and accept to follow the rules above. It will take some time, I know. You will soon feel everything runs smoothly.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your command line, change the directory to the repository location (`AI-intro-project` by default). There are more than two ways of doing this:
  - If you want to use VSCode: open GitHub Desktop, choose Open in Visual Studio Code. In VSCode, create a terminal, and the directory is already there.
  - If you want to use Windows' command line: open it and `cd` there.
3. Run `pip install .`, this will install a package named `AIIntroProject`.
4. Take a look at [`hello_world.py`](https://github.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/blob/main/AI_intro_project/hello_world.py) and [`test_hello_world.py`](https://github.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/blob/main/tests/test_hello_world.py) to understand importation.
5. Start doing your things. Remember to follow the rules, since you are not working alone.
