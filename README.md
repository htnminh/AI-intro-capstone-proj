# The Penniless Pilgrim Riddle: Introduction
The website of the project: <https://htnminh.github.io/AI-intro-project/>

A capstone project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. <br>
A quick introduction of the problem: [Can you solve the penniless pilgrim riddle? - Daniel Finkel](https://youtu.be/6sBB-gRhfjE).

In short, we will keep the original rules of the game, but randomize the board size and the "forced moves" (aka. the initial state).

# CALL REFERENCES: CODING
> DEAR COLLABORATORS, I WILL MAKE A WHOLE SITE ONLY FOR THIS, YOU BETTER NOT ASK ME ANYTHING THAT EXIST HERE.

# Play the game!
Five easy steps to play the game:
1. Make sure that Python and pip are installed on your local machine
2. Download this repository, unzip it
3. Open cmd, change the directory to the folder above (`AI-intro-project-main` by default)
4. Run <br>`pip install .`
5. Run <br>`python AI_intro_project\play.py`<br> to open the UI above

If you want to completely remove the game, just delete the zip file and the directory specified above.

# Collaborators
We are K65 of Hanoi University of Science and Technology, major in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Under the guidance of our lecturer, Professor Muriel Visani, we will together solve this riddle.

# Guide for Collaborators: A guide for everything

## End-to-end rules to work in this project
[Rules](docs/rules.md). If you have worked with me for a while, you should know those. 

## Guide to GitHub
[Guide to GitHub](docs/guide_to_GitHub.md). If you are new to GitHub or Git, please, read it, practice on GitHub.

> I will not accept non-git-like-operations on the repo, e.g. make changes and reupload a whole directory, since I do not know what did you do.
Moreover, I have no time to read your commits and revert them if you make a mistake.

Practice working on GitHub until you feel confident, and you will be fine.

## Guide to publication
We should use Notion page for now, because it is easy to use.

> Update: We have a report left, it is long, but a Notion page will work quite well.
   
<!--
### Start working
Start working only if you understand and accept to follow the rules above. It will take some time, I know. You will soon feel everything runs smoothly.
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your command line, change the directory to the repository location (`AI-intro-project` by default). There are more than two ways of doing this:
  - If you want to use VSCode: open GitHub Desktop, choose Open in Visual Studio Code. In VSCode, create a terminal, and the directory is already there.
  - If you want to use Windows' command line: open it and `cd` there.
3. Run `pip install .`, this will install a package named `AIIntroProject`.
4. Take a look at [`hello_world.py`](https://github.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/blob/main/AI_intro_project/hello_world.py) and [`test_hello_world.py`](https://github.com/htnminh/AI-intro-project/blob/main/tests/test_hello_world.py) to understand importation.
5. Start doing your things. Remember to follow the rules, since you are not working alone.
