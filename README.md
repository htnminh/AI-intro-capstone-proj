# The Penniless Pilgrim Riddle: Introduction
The website of the project: <https://htnminh.github.io/AI-intro-project/>

A capstone project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. <br>
A quick introduction of the problem: [Can you solve the penniless pilgrim riddle? - Daniel Finkel](https://youtu.be/6sBB-gRhfjE).

In short, we will keep the original rules of the game, but randomize the board size and the "forced moves" (aka. the initial state).

# Play the game!
Five easy steps to play the game:
1. Make sure that Python and pip are installed on your local machine
2. Download this repository, unzip it
3. Open cmd, change the directory to the folder above (`AI-intro-project-main` by default)
4. Run <br>`pip install .`
5. Run <br>`python AI_intro_project\play.py`<br> to open the UI above

If you want to completely remove the game, just delete the zip file and the directory specified above.

# Collaborators

# Guide for Collaborators: A guide for everything

## End-to-end rules to work in this project
[Rules](docs/rules.md). If you have worked with me for a while, you should know those. 

## Guide to GitHub
[Guide to GitHub](docs/guide_to_GitHub.md). If you are new to GitHub or Git, please, read it, practice on GitHub.

> I will not accept non-git-like-operations on the repo, e.g. make changes and reupload a whole directory, since I do not know what did you do.
Moreover, I have no time to read your commits and revert them if you make a mistake.

Practice working on GitHub until you feel confident, and you will be fine.

## Guide to publication
We should use Notion page for now, because it is easy to use.

> Update: We have a report left, it is long, but a Notion page will work quite well.
