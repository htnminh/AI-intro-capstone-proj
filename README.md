# The Penniless Pilgrim Riddle: Introduction

A capstone project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. <br>
A quick introduction of the problem: [Can you solve the penniless pilgrim riddle? - Daniel Finkel](https://youtu.be/6sBB-gRhfjE).

In short, we will keep the original rules of the game, but randomize the board size and the "forced moves" (aka. the initial state).

# Play the game!
Five easy steps to play the game:
1. Make sure that Python (3.9.9) and pip (21.x) are installed on your local machine
2. Download this repository, unzip it (it's safe to use the option `Extract here`)
3. Open cmd (or terminal), navigate (using `cd`) to that folder (`AI-intro-project-main` by default)
4. Run <br>`pip install .`
5. Run <br>`python AI_intro_project\play.py`<br> to open the UI above

If you want to completely remove the game, just delete the zip file and the folder specified above.

WARNING: Running algorithms or analytical files might cause your computer to get
a bit slow and laggy. Use at your own risk.

# Introduction to files and directories in the repository
Important:
- `AI_intro_project\Coordinate_and_Move.py` and `AI_intro_project\State.py`:
    The core game.
- `AI_intro_project\play.py`:
    The UI of the game.
- `AI_intro_project\StateRandomizer.py`:
    The file to randomly generate and save initial states.
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\astar_Sfirst.py`:
    The implementation of A*.
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\dfs.py`:
    The implementation of DFS.
- `AI_intro_project\search_algo\recursive_BFS.py`:
    The implementation of RBFS.
- `publication\group17-presentation.pdf`: The presentation.
- `publication\group17-report.pdf`: The report.

Interesting:
- `AI_intro_project\_initial_states_images`: The images of the randomized initial states.
- `AI_intro_project\_RBFS_solved_state_images`: The images of the solution generated by RBFS algorithm.
- `AI_intro_project\_s_astar-Sf_solved_state_images`: The images of the solution generated by A* algorithm.
- `AI_intro_project\_s_DFS_solved_state_images`: The images of the solution generated by DFS algorithm.
- `AI_intro_project\randomized_states`: The pickle files (default `.pkl` but we use `.state` to distinguish) of the randomized initial states.
